Revision history for Perl extension Finance-Robinhood

{{$NEXT}}

0.08 2016-06-27T19:49:09Z

    - Updating several examples due to API changes and (mostly) lazy bugs
    - Though meaningless for market orders, the 'price' value is now required by the API
        If it's missing in your call to ::Order->new(...), quote data is requested for
        the instrument and the current bid price is used.

	- Historical quotes correctly request a defined span
	- Example script found at eg/export_orders.pl only exports executed orders by default
	    - Override this with --all

    - ::Order->executions() was dropping all but timestamp and settlement_date
    - Next and previous cursor information was leaking in paginated data
    - New demo script: eg/export_orders.pl
        - Grabs entire order history and writes it to a file or STDOUT as CSV

    - Get watchlist by name with ::Robinhood->watchlist(...)
